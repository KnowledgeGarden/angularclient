# angularclient
An Angular 1+ Web Client, designed to work with BacksideServlet, a Java webservices servlet.

Right now, it is only coded to the level of user account management.

**Note (20150719)**: Very much still in development. For instance, many aspects of paths are still not solved. For instance, the system is configured (in "localhost" mode -- see /app/js/config.js) to boot localhost:8000. If one simply runs the npm "start" script (and if it works properly), the system will come up properly. When the start script fails, "node server.js" will boot the system, but then one must click on index.html to get it started. As I said, there remains much to do to get the platform running correctly.
 

Code developed with WebStorm 10+ and based on code from [Angular-Seed](Angular-Seed "https://github.com/angular/angular-seed") and from [KnAllEdge](KnAllEdge "https://github.com/mprinc/KnAllEdge")
